# 🍕 SQL Data Analysis Project – Pizza Sales Dataset

This project demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be used to analyze sales data for a pizza restaurant. I used MySQL to extract insights related to revenue, customer preferences, peak business hours, and product performance. The analysis mimics a real-world business intelligence task to support data-driven decisions.
